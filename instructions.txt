Setup environment was done by following the instructions in this link.
Only the first part of the instructions was followed (the client part), which includes the react client.

To run:

1) In the root, run: npm install
2) In the client folder, run: npm install
3) In the server folder, run: npm install
4) Download python 3.7+ if you don't have it, in the file server/routes/index.js in line 29 replace pythonPath with your local path to the python installation, this is a server side procedure so it needs to be done manually.
5) Also if you don't have, install pip for python, you can follow the instructions on https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/, you'll need this to install python depedencies.
6) In the directory server/public on the cmd run: python/py -m pip install -r requirements.txt to install all required python dependencies. After installing you can test your installation by running python ./clustering.py on the directory, it should output "Depdendencies installed!" if it complains about a specific depedency you should manually install it by running python -m pip install <depedency>.
7) In the root, run: npm start root

Go to localhost:3000 for client web page
Go to localhost:3001 for server (Express)

It should work, I hope.
