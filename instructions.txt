Setup environment was done by following the instructions in this link.
Only the first part of the instructions was followed (the client part), which includes the react client.

To run:

In the root, run: npm install
In the client folder, run: npm install
In the server folder, run: npm install

In the root, run: npm start

Go to localhost:3000 for client web page
Go to localhost:3001 for server (Express)

It should work, I hope.
